###  **Week 3 — Eco-Dynamics & Analytical Modeling**

**Objective:** Correlate traffic flow complexity with eco-efficiency and emissions

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Implement **eco-dynamic model equations**
  $$
  \text{Efficiency} = \alpha e^{−βS} + γ,\quad E_{CO₂} = κ₁σ_v² + κ₂S + κ₃
  $$
* [ ] Perform **correlation analysis** between entropy trends and estimated CO₂ output
* [ ] Develop **real-time spatiotemporal entropy heatmaps** for visual pattern analysis
* [ ] Conduct **multi-segment traffic analysis** (e.g., morning vs evening sessions)
* [ ] Generate **integrated analytics dashboards** showing entropy, efficiency, and emission metrics

###  **Week 4 — System Integration & Reporting**

**Objective:** Finalize modular architecture, visualization, and documentation

**Tasks:**

* [ ] Consolidate all modules into a **Jupyter/Colab-based pipeline**
  *(Detection → Tracking → Entropy → Eco-Analytics)*
* [ ] Prototype a **FastAPI dashboard mock** for near real-time visualization
* [ ] Create **summary video output** overlaying live system metrics
* [ ] Compile **final research report** including results, plots, and interpretations
* [ ] Prepare **presentation slides/poster** with key visuals and findings
